# Technigo-final-project

## Description

An environment focused app where the user can log environment friendly actions
in the day to day app. The main purpose is to get the user to take more
environmental friendly choices in the day to day life.

The user will create their profile where they can track their actions daily and
view a leaderboard of the 10 top users. The leaderboard can be filtered by time
period and country. The user gets information on how to be more actively
environmental friendly in their day to day life and suggestions on actions. They
will also be able to mark actions as done and erase actions from their completed
tasks list.

We have used JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Moment, Lodash, Styled
Components for this project.
