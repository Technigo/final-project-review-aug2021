# Final Project: FOAJÃ‰

### by: Elin Elmvik Diczfalusy

Requirments:

- Frontend in React (Redux optional)
- Backend in Node.js
- MongoDB database
- Navigation using React Router
- Should work in Chrome, Firefox & Safari
- Be responsive and work well on mobile, tablet and phone

## The problem

Tech stack

- BE: node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Heroku
- FE: React, React Router, React Redux, Redux Toolkit, Material UI, Netlify

The project is the mvp of a company idea called Foaje, which will be a mix between Blocket and Fiver (eventually) to make it easier for customers to support female up to 50% female owned companies. You will be able to search for different companies, skills and location. You will be able to do reviews and read about companies.

I decided to take on a few new challenges and tried many different collections connected to each other. I also tried material UI for the first time. It has been time consuming to read so much documentations and I am not really sure I will redo that choice.

Example for improvement:

- Let the user add their own photos
- Let the users send messages to each other
- Edit the user
