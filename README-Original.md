**Welcome to Final Project Review repo for aug2021 class!**

If you would like to receive code review from Technigo team, you need to create pull request to this repository.

Since your own repositories - those ones where you keep your final projects - were not forked from this repo, you will need to follow couple of steps to make pull request possible :

1. Make a fork of this repository
2. Clone that forked repo to your local machine
3. On your local machine, directly copy and paste WHOLE content of your final project, so it contains all of the files (**remember to exclude node_modules and .env files!**)
4. Add, commit and push your changes to forked repo
5. Submit pull request
